# How the chatbot mesh works

This is a reader's walkthrough of the chatbot mesh: what the parts are, how a
single question turns into a grounded answer, and how the mesh reconfigures
itself while it runs. It is the prose companion to the machine-readable
[ARCHITECTURE.yaml](ARCHITECTURE.yaml). Where a claim needs a normative source,
we link the software requirements document (SRD) rather than restate it.

The one idea to carry through: there is no bespoke orchestration code. Every
agent is a YAML profile the shared agent-core runtime loads, the way a jar runs
on a JVM. The topology, the tier selection, the retrieval fan-out, and the deployment
are configuration.

## Two planes

We split the mesh into a data plane that answers chat turns and a control plane
that reconfigures the mesh. The data plane serves the browser; the control plane
provisions new knowledge sources and rolls agents without stopping the service.

  end

  User -->|chat turn| CB
  User -->|provisioning intent| CO

  CB -->|embed once| OLL
  CB -->|fan out one vector| R0 --> CH0

  ING -->|seed| CH0

  CO -->|declared-client request| CR
  CR -->|values edit + rollout| EX

  CR -.->|health| CO
```

The governing rule in the control plane is that the provisioning-workflow-orchestrator decides and the
creator acts. The provisioning-workflow-orchestrator is the sole author of the values change; the
creator is the only agent that holds deployment-API credentials and the only one
that realizes the change. Every instance operation travels as a declared-client
request from provisioning-workflow-orchestrator to creator, never as a direct deployment-API call.

## The components

We list each agent and service with its home directory and its job. Retrieval-
augmented generation is abbreviated RAG; the single-page application is the SPA.

Table 1: Mesh components

| Component | Plane | Job |
|---|---|---|
| Chatbot agent (`agents/chatbot/`) | data | Run the turn: embed once, select a model tier, fan out, compose, answer; host the SPA |
| RAG server agent (`agents/rag-server/`) | data | Vector-in retrieval against one Chroma collection; one agent per corpus |
| Corpus-ingest wrapper (`agents/corpus-ingest/`) + canonical library agent | data | Seed Chroma after machine-owned trusted-path discovery; the mesh supplies REST/model/collection values |
| Provisioning Workflow Orchestrator (`agents/provisioning-workflow-orchestrator/`) | control | Decide the values change; sequence ingest and reconfiguration |
| Creator (`agents/creator/`) | control | Act: agent lifecycle and request-draining rollout; holds deployment-API authority |
| Applier (`agents/applier/`) | control | Declarative deployment API (srd006) the creator drives; validate-apply-verify-rollback binding helm/kubectl exec words |
| User interface (`agents/chatbot/ui/`) | both | The SPA with chat, observability, and provisioning panels |
| Helm chart (`helm/`) | deploy | Deploy the whole mesh as one chart from values-driven RAG pairs |

The normative detail lives in the SRDs: the RAG server in
[srd001](specs/software-requirements/srd001-rag-server-agent.yaml), the chatbot in
[srd002](specs/software-requirements/srd002-chatbot-agent.yaml), the deployment in
[srd003](specs/software-requirements/srd003-chatbot-deployment.yaml), the
provisioning-workflow-orchestrator in [srd004](specs/software-requirements/srd004-provisioning-workflow-orchestrator.yaml), the
creator in [srd005](specs/software-requirements/srd005-creator.yaml), and the
applier in [srd006](specs/software-requirements/srd006-applier.yaml).

## A single chat turn

Each turn is a request-scoped state machine run. The move that shapes everything
else is embed once, fan out: the chatbot embeds the question a single time and
sends that one vector to every selected RAG server. This is why a RAG server
accepts a vector rather than text — re-embedding per server would waste work and
risk drift between embedding spaces (srd001, srd002 R1.3).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Browser SPA
  participant CB as Chatbot agent
  participant O as Ollama (embed)
  participant TS as LLM tier selector
  participant R0 as RAG server 0
  participant R1 as RAG server 1

  B->>CB: chat request (+ full history, stateless v1)
  CB->>O: embed the question (once)
  O-->>CB: query vector

  CB->>TS: classify the original question ($tool tier selector)
  TS-->>CB: pick a chat-LLM word<br/>(bad pick falls back to a default word)

  par fan out the same vector
    CB->>R0: query_embeddings
    R0-->>CB: chunks (+ embedding-model metadata)
  and
    CB->>R1: query_embeddings
    R1-->>CB: chunks
  end

  Note over CB: exclude a RAG whose embedding model<br/>differs from the query vector's;<br/>a failed RAG degrades to a mapped 200
  CB->>CB: compose the answer prompt<br/>via $from(label).path selectors
  CB-->>B: grounded answer (+ degradation metadata)
```

Two mechanics carry the turn. The tier selector is one classifier LLM (large language
model) call whose response the chatbot parses through a `$tool` indirection to
select a chat-LLM word; a misparse or out-of-set pick falls back to a configured
default word rather than failing the turn (srd002 R2). Composition reaches
non-adjacent data — the original question, the tier selection, the retrieved
chunks — through command-state `$from(label).path` selectors rather than by
threading it through every intervening machine step; the `compose` builtin
renders the grounding prompt from those selectors (srd002 R1.2).

Degradation keeps a turn answerable. A per-RAG failure maps to a 200 composed
from the surviving chunks, and a RAG whose embedding model does not match the
query vector is excluded; both outcomes are noted in the response metadata
(srd002 R3). Version one is stateless: the browser sends the conversation
history each turn and there is no server-side session store (srd002 R4).

## Reconfiguring the mesh live

The control plane adds a knowledge source without downtime, following the path
intent → ingest → reconfigure → rolling restart → serve.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as Provisioning panel
  participant CB as Chatbot (UX)
  participant CO as Provisioning Workflow Orchestrator (decides)
  participant CR as Creator (acts)
  participant API as Deployment API

  U->>CB: add a source from a directory
  CB->>CO: provisioning intent<br/>(no host, URL, or credential)
  CO->>CR: ingest request per directory
  CR-->>CO: collection counts verified
  CO->>CO: decide the values change (sole author)
  CO->>CR: rollout request
  CR->>API: edit values + request-draining rollout
  Note over CR,API: old pods complete active HTTP turns;<br/>replacement pods serve later turns
  CR-->>CO: health OK
  CO-->>U: aggregated status
  Note over U: the new source now answers grounded turns
```

The transport-authority boundary holds across this flow: the user's intent never
carries a host, URL, method, or credential. Endpoints are fixed in declared REST
clients, and runtime input cannot acquire transport authority (srd002 R6, srd003
R4, srd004 R4, srd005 R5). The creator alone holds deployment-API credentials.
The rollout drains active requests. Kubernetes invokes the old chatbot's declared
lifecycle exit, its HTTP server completes active `machine_request` responses, and
the replacement pod serves later turns (srd003 R3.2). Dolt remains the durable
checkpoint backend for explicit history, rollback, and resume operations; it
cannot reattach an HTTP connection owned by a terminated process.

## How it deploys

One Helm chart deploys the whole mesh. The property that keeps it coherent is
values co-generation: a single `ragUnits` list renders the RAG server objects,
the chatbot's ordered runtime topology, REST network allowlist, and monitor
upstreams. One selected-target RAG operation and one sequential `for_each` serve
the whole list, so authority cannot drift while word and state counts stay fixed
(srd003 R2).

```mermaid

  ING["Ingress"] --> CB["Chatbot agent<br/>UX + turn machine"]
  CB --> R1["RAG agent 1"] --> C1[("Chroma 1")]
  CB --> RN["RAG agent N"] --> CN[("Chroma N")]
  CB -->|embed / chat| LLM["LLM tier:<br/>in-cluster Ollama (default)<br/>or external endpoint"]
  JOB["Model-preload Job"] -->|pull to PVC| LLM
  LLM -.->|/api/tags readiness gate| CB
  CB -->|checkpoint / resume| DOLT[("Dolt backend")]
  CB --> COL["OTel collector"]
  R1 --> COL
  RN --> COL
  COL -->|spool| SP[("NDJSON spool")]
  COL -.->|relay| EXT["external OTLP endpoint"]

  VAL[["values.yaml ragUnits list"]] -.co-generates.-> R1
  VAL -.co-generates.-> RN
  VAL -.co-generates.-> CB
```

A fresh cluster answers a turn with no external dependency. The in-cluster
Ollama model tier is on by default, backed by a persistent volume, preloaded by a
Job, and readiness-gated on `/api/tags` (srd003 R6). Setting `ollama.enabled=false`
points the mesh at an external endpoint without changing the co-generation
contract. Every agent exports OpenTelemetry (OTLP) to an in-cluster collector and
on to a trace backend; cross-agent continuity rides W3C traceparent propagation,
with per-agent monitor streams as the version-one fallback (srd003 R5).

## Where to read more

The [road map](road-map.yaml) sequences the six releases from the single-RAG turn
through the control plane. The [use cases](specs/use-cases/) narrate each
release's flow with inputs and expected outputs, and the
[test suites](specs/test-suites/) validate them. For the standalone-program
framing and the extraction decisions, see the [README](../README.md).
