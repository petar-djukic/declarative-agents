{{/*
The chatbot ui.yaml, co-generated from .Values.ragUnits (srd003 R2). The
monitored-agents list derives from the same RAG list as the topology and the
rest.yaml monitor_proxy upstreams, so the observability panel's per-agent
sub-panels track the deployed RAGs. The packaged agents/chatbot/ui/ui.yaml
stays the local source; this render overrides that ConfigMap key in the cluster.
