# Packaging the agent-architecture chart

`mage helm:package` produces a self-contained archive under `helm/dist/`. The chart
carries three profile closures under `profiles/`, staged fresh at package time
because `helm/profiles/` is gitignored:

- `profiles/curator/` and `profiles/collector/` are catalog-owned closures,
  regenerated from the pinned catalog checkout by `mage helmPrepare` and recorded in
  a checksum-bearing `prepared-manifest.yaml`.
- `profiles/applier/` is the application-owned composition-wrapper closure over
  the canonical catalog applier. It is selected by the manifest's `applier` deployment entry
  and mounted when `applier.enabled` is set.

The same composition manifest declares all four UI assets and the opaque
catalog `docs/` package asset with ownership, runtime, and package paths. When
the curator payload exceeds the ConfigMap limit, those declared assets alone
are packed into out-of-release shards. Package code does not walk an additional
catalog docs root.

The generated `prepared-manifest.yaml` metadata now uses the generic
`asset_roots` and `external_asset_roots` names in place of the UI-only names.
Archive member paths, mounted runtime paths, and source asset bytes are
unchanged.

## Applier exec-declarations placeholder rewrite

The applier's `exec-declarations.yaml` ships placeholder coordinates -- the release
name `agent-architecture`, namespace `default`, and the `agent-architecture-collector`
Deployment -- kept as valid YAML so agent-core validation passes. At render time the
`applier.yaml` template rewrites those placeholders to the installed release: the
release name and namespace from `Release.Name` and `Release.Namespace`, and the
Deployment to `<fullname>-collector`. An applier installed under any release name
therefore targets its own release, namespace, and collector Deployment rather than a
baked default.

The applier verifies and reads the collector Deployment (the application's
persistent, k8s-ready server), not the bounded documentation-curator, so only the
collector Deployment token appears in the rewrite.
