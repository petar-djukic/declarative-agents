# Package Layout

This repository uses a domain-oriented Go package layout. Application-private
code lives under `internal/`; `pkg/` is reserved for intentionally supported
public Go APIs. Placement rules are defined in
`docs/constitutions/boundaries.yaml`; this file keeps the inventory.

## Ownership Rules

- `cmd/` remains the composition root for binaries.
- `internal/` contains private implementation packages for this repository.
- `pkg/` is reserved for stable, documented library APIs. If a package remains
  under `pkg/`, the reason should be explicit in the migration issue.
- `pkg/spec` is intentionally retained as a public package for the current
  restructuring. It provides typed specification artifacts, parsing, corpus
  loading, graph construction, validation, and formatted findings used by both
  planning and audit flows.
- `pkg/profileaudit` is a public package for profile-startup audit used by
  `cmd/agent` and catalog gates. It currently imports internal catalog, REST,
  runtime, and support surfaces listed in `internal/boundaries/boundaries_baseline.txt`.
- `agents/`, `tools/`, `docs/`, and `testdata/` remain configuration,
  specification, and fixture directories rather than Go package domains.
- Each migration should preserve behavior first. Rename symbols or redesign APIs
  only in separate follow-up work.

## CLI Flag Ownership

A CLI flag is defined by the package that consumes it, in a `Config` struct
with `RegisterFlags(fs *pflag.FlagSet)`. `cmd` packages register flags only for
binary-contract concerns (profile selection, output paths, validation mode) and
call `RegisterFlags` for everything else. Registration happens only from `cmd`;
no package touches a flagset at import time.

Flags whose resolution spans the whole binary stay in `cmd/agent`:

- `--profile`
- `--core-root`
- `--directory`
- `--request`
- `--output`
- `--child-agent-binary`
- `--validate-config`

Component-owned flags:

- `internal/observability/telemetry`: `--otel-log-file`, `--otel-otlp-endpoint`,
  `--otel-metric-otlp-endpoint`, `--otel-service-name`, `--otel-parent-span`,
  `--telemetry-capture`, `--verbose-trace`
- `internal/runtime/checkpoint`: `--dolt-dsn`, `--resume-checkpoint`,
  `--resume-signal`
- `internal/tools/dolt`: `--dolt-connection`

## Builtin Factory Ownership

A builtin init is registered by the package that builds the command, through a
package-level `RegisterFactories(br, deps)` entry point. `cmd/agent` supplies
`FactoryDeps` and never registers an init directly. Catalog probes invoke every
registrar against a throwaway registry, so registrars must be side-effect-free
apart from `br.Register` calls.

## Target Domains

- `internal/runtime`: agent loop runtime, state machines, dispatch,
  checkpoints (`internal/runtime/checkpoint` owns Dolt DSN and resume flags),
  rollback, and workspace refs.
- `internal/tools`: standard tool library behavior split across focused packages
  for catalog loading, registration, file, exec, lifecycle, validation, control,
  undo, REST, and LLM tool implementations.
- `internal/evaluation`: evaluator session/point runtime, result artifacts,
  metrics, convergence, trace analysis, and read-only artifact query words.
  Bench routes, UI, and orchestration live in the external bench profile.
- `internal/model`: LLM clients, provider adapters, prompt rendering, model
  profiles, and tool manifest assembly.
- `internal/planning`: task extraction, spec graphs used for planning,
  implementation plans, tracker-result state adapters, and pipeline orchestration.
- `internal/audit`: jurist orchestration and audit-specific tool
  glue. Shared specification parsing and validation remain in `pkg/spec`.
- `internal/observability`: tracing ports, OpenTelemetry adapters, GenAI span
  helpers, and trace replay support.
- `internal/support`: private process, workspace, and CLI helper code. This
  domain contains process execution, subprocess, worktree, and CLI utilities.
- `internal/version`: link-time binary identity (Version, Commit, Date)
  consumed by cmd/agent and the OTel service.version resource attribute.

## Current Go Package Inventory

Generated from `go list ./...`. The boundaries gate checks this list.

- `cmd/agent`

- `internal/model`
- `internal/model/llm`

- `internal/tools/registry`
- `internal/tools/rest`
- `internal/tools/rest/client`
- `internal/tools/rest/credentials`
- `internal/tools/rest/definition`
- `internal/tools/rest/mock`
- `internal/tools/rest/monitor`
- `internal/tools/rest/redact`
- `internal/tools/rest/resttest`
- `internal/tools/rest/servercmd`
- `internal/tools/rest/validation`
- `internal/tools/service`
- `internal/tools/undo`
- `internal/tools/validation`
- `internal/version`
- `pkg/profileaudit`
- `pkg/spec`

REST subpackages layer as definition (model and loading) under validation; the
parent keeps collection and the server runtime on top; client, credentials,
redact, monitor, mock, and servercmd are leaves the parent imports.

Public `pkg/` packages are `pkg/spec` and `pkg/profileaudit`.

## Migration Order

1. Introduce the `internal/` skeleton and this ownership document.
2. Move observability first or alongside runtime, because runtime depends on
   tracing and telemetry types. Done: observability and support utilities now
   live under `internal/observability` and `internal/support`.
3. Move runtime/core packages under `internal/runtime`.
4. Move LLM and prompt packages under `internal/model`.
5. Move planning pipeline packages under `internal/planning`.
6. Split the standard tool library by domain before moving evaluator, audit, or
   model-specific tool implementations. Done: generic tool behavior now lives in
   focused `internal/tools/*` packages, and evaluator session/point/result code
   lives under `internal/evaluation`.
7. Keep reusable evaluation analysis under `internal/evaluation`; move bench
   routes, UI assets, and workflow policy to `applications/catalog/agents/bench`.
   Done: the universal runtime links no bench application package.
8. Keep shared specification parsing and validation in `pkg/spec`; move only
   jurist-specific orchestration under `internal/audit`.
9. Update docs, build scripts, audit rules, and remove empty old package paths.

## Guardrails

- Keep each migration small enough to review as one domain move.
- Run `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` after each migration.
- Avoid adding compatibility shims for unshipped package paths on the current
  branch; update imports directly unless a package is intentionally public.
- Do not move configuration YAML files as part of Go package moves unless the
  owning issue explicitly includes config layout.
