# Package Layout

This repository uses a domain-oriented Go package layout. Application-private
code lives under `internal/`; `pkg/` is reserved for intentionally supported
public Go APIs.

## Ownership Rules

- `cmd/` remains the composition root for binaries.
- `internal/` contains private implementation packages for this repository.
- `pkg/` is reserved for stable, documented library APIs. If a package remains
  under `pkg/`, the reason should be explicit in the migration issue.
- `pkg/spec` is intentionally retained as a public package for the current
  restructuring. It provides typed specification artifacts, parsing, corpus
  loading, graph construction, validation, and formatted findings used by both
  planning and audit flows.
- `agents/`, `tools/`, `docs/`, and `testdata/` remain configuration,
  specification, and fixture directories rather than Go package domains.
- Each migration should preserve behavior first. Rename symbols or redesign APIs
  only in separate follow-up work.

## Target Domains

- `internal/runtime`: agent loop runtime, state machines, dispatch,
  checkpoints, rollback, and workspace refs.
- `internal/tools`: standard tool library behavior split across focused packages
  for catalog loading, registration, file, exec, lifecycle, validation, control,
  undo, REST, and LLM tool implementations.
- `internal/evaluation`: evaluator session/point runtime, result artifacts,
  metrics, convergence, trace analysis, and read-only artifact query words.
  Bench routes, UI, and orchestration live in the external bench profile.
- `internal/model`: LLM clients, provider adapters, prompt rendering, model
  profiles, and tool manifest assembly.
- `internal/planning`: task extraction, spec graphs used for planning,
  implementation plans, tracker-result state adapters, and pipeline orchestration.
- `internal/audit`: jurist orchestration and audit-specific tool
  glue. Shared specification parsing and validation remain in `pkg/spec`.
- `internal/observability`: tracing ports, OpenTelemetry adapters, GenAI span
  helpers, and trace replay support.
- `internal/support`: private process, workspace, and CLI helper code. This
  domain contains process execution, subprocess, worktree, and CLI utilities.

## Current Go Package Inventory

Generated from `go list ./...` after the internal package migration:

- `cmd/agent`
- `internal/evaluation`
- `internal/model`
- `internal/model/llm`
- `internal/model/llm/ollama`
- `internal/model/prompt`
- `internal/observability`
- `internal/observability/monitor`
- `internal/observability/telemetry`
- `internal/observability/telemetry/genai`
- `internal/observability/tracing`
- `internal/planning`
- `internal/planning/extract`
- `internal/planning/graph`
- `internal/planning/pipeline`
- `internal/planning/plan`
- `internal/runtime`
- `internal/runtime/core`
- `internal/support`
- `internal/support/cli`
- `internal/support/execute`
- `internal/support/subprocess`
- `internal/tools`
- `internal/tools/catalog`
- `internal/tools/control`
- `internal/tools/exec`
- `internal/tools/filesystem`
- `internal/tools/lifecycle`
- `internal/tools/llm`
- `internal/tools/registry`
- `internal/tools/rest`
- `internal/tools/undo`
- `internal/tools/validation`
- `pkg/spec`

`pkg/spec` is the only current public `pkg/` package.

## Migration Order

1. Introduce the `internal/` skeleton and this ownership document.
2. Move observability first or alongside runtime, because runtime depends on
   tracing and telemetry types. Done: observability and support utilities now
   live under `internal/observability` and `internal/support`.
3. Move runtime/core packages under `internal/runtime`.
4. Move LLM and prompt packages under `internal/model`.
5. Move planning pipeline packages under `internal/planning`.
6. Split the standard tool library by domain before moving evaluator, audit, or
   model-specific tool implementations. Done: generic tool behavior now lives in
   focused `internal/tools/*` packages, and evaluator session/point/result code
   lives under `internal/evaluation`.
7. Keep reusable evaluation analysis under `internal/evaluation`; move bench
   routes, UI assets, and workflow policy to `applications/catalog/agents/bench`.
   Done: the universal runtime links no bench application package.
8. Keep shared specification parsing and validation in `pkg/spec`; move only
   jurist-specific orchestration under `internal/audit`.
9. Update docs, build scripts, audit rules, and remove empty old package paths.

## Guardrails

- Keep each migration small enough to review as one domain move.
- Run `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` after each migration.
- Avoid adding compatibility shims for unshipped package paths on the current
  branch; update imports directly unless a package is intentionally public.
- Do not move configuration YAML files as part of Go package moves unless the
  owning issue explicitly includes config layout.
