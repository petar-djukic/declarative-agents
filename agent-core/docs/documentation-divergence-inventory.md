# Documentation Divergence Inventory

This inventory records documentation drift found by comparing the current source
tree, agent configuration, and audit output. It is a planning artifact for
`agent-core-9ilp`; follow-up issues should update documentation without changing
runtime behavior unless a follow-up explicitly calls out a source correction.

## Verification Baseline

- `mage docker` requires Docker.
- `go list ./...` reports 29 Go packages.
- `git ls-files '*.yaml'` reports 189 tracked YAML files.
- `mage stats` reports 21,265 Go source lines, 15,197 Go test lines, and
  188 YAML files in its project docs/config/other categories.
- `mage audit` passes. Remaining findings are warning-only pre-existing
  coverage/traceability categories: `docspec-broken-related-document`,
  `orphaned-srd`, `release-without-test-suite`, and `uncovered-ac`.
- `git diff --check` passes.
- Focused Docker Mage helper tests pass with
  `go test magefiles/docker.go magefiles/release.go magefiles/docker_test.go magefiles/release_test.go`.
- IDE lints are clean for the touched README and inventory files.
- `mage docker` has built a slim runtime image from remote release
  `v0.20260612.1`; the Docker-built check image reports 77.9 MB and the
  Docker-built `agent-core:latest` reports 54.6 MB.

## README Runtime Positioning

Source evidence:
- `cmd/agent/main.go` is the unified binary entry point; generator, planner,
  evaluator, bench, and jurist behavior is selected through YAML
  profiles and tool declarations.
- `agents/*/profile.yaml` files are the normal runtime entry points.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.yaml` now describes the system as a single binary driving
  configured agents.

Documentation drift:
- `README.md` still opens as "A Go framework for building tool-augmented
  agentic loops" and says "Domain agents import agent-core". That no longer
  captures the primary usage model: a universal `agent` runtime plus YAML agent
  profiles.
- The README package table is useful but does not orient readers around the
  external active agents (`$AGENT_CATALOG_ROOT/agents/executor`,
  `$AGENT_CATALOG_ROOT/agents/critic`, `$AGENT_CATALOG_ROOT/agents/planner`,
  `$AGENT_CATALOG_ROOT/agents/bench`, `$AGENT_CATALOG_ROOT/agents/specification-critic`) or
  profile-first startup.

Recommended edits:
- Refresh the README introduction around Agent Core as a declarative runtime.
- Keep package information concise, but add a current "Agent Profiles" or
  "Runtime Configuration" section that points at active profile files.
- Keep legacy flags out of the happy path and mention them only as
  compatibility behavior when needed.

Status: addressed by `agent-core-9ilp.3`.

## Docker And Mage Release Image Workflow

Source evidence:
- `Dockerfile` is a two-stage build: Go source, tests, and build dependencies
  stay in the builder; the runtime stage is Alpine with `agent`, git/Unix
  utilities, and selected YAML config under `/opt/agent-core`.
- `magefiles/docker.go` resolves the latest remote release tag by default,
  reads optional release and image overrides from `demo.yaml`, passes the
  resolved ref to Docker as `AGENT_CORE_REF`, defaults the build secret to
  repository-local `.netrc`, and prints the build settings plus the exact
  command.
- `.gitignore` ignores `.netrc`, `docker-build-secret-*`, and
  `magefiles/mage_output_file.go`.

Documentation drift:
- `README.md` contains the only Docker/Mage release-image documentation. The
  broader docs set does not yet mention the containerized runtime packaging,
  release-ref selection, or `/opt/agent-core` shared config asset layout.
- README examples still contain a concrete release ref
  (`v0.20260612.1`). That is useful as a verification note but should not look
  like a permanent recommended version; current source resolves the latest
  remote release dynamically.
- The current runtime image intentionally does not include Go or
  `golangci-lint`, but active exec declarations include `build`, `vet`, `test`,
  and `lint` commands. Documentation should explain whether the container image
  is a minimal agent runtime only, or whether language/toolchain images are
  expected to extend it for code-generation validation.

Recommended edits:
- Update README Docker wording after the current Docker-preference change lands.
- Add a docs/ architecture or runtime-contract note for the release image and
  `/opt/agent-core` asset layout.
- Clarify the minimal runtime image versus language/toolchain requirements for
  exec tools.

Status:
- docs/ release-image and `/opt/agent-core` layout coverage addressed by
  `agent-core-9ilp.2`.
- README wording and examples addressed by `agent-core-9ilp.3`.

## Bench Launch Documentation

Source evidence:
- `applications/catalog/agents/bench/builtin.yaml` aliases generic REST lifecycle,
  `value_predicate`, and `self_invoke` words.
- `applications/catalog/agents/bench/rest.yaml` owns routes, static assets, queue
  configuration, and action-to-signal mapping.
- `applications/catalog/agents/bench/machine.yaml` validates launch input and invokes
  the critic profile through `self_invoke`.

Resolved drift:
- GH-888 removed the `serve_ui` and `launch_eval` Go words and updated the bench
  use case, runtime contract, SRDs, tool catalogs, and conformance evidence to
  describe generic REST and `self_invoke`.
- The browser action payload retains `type: launch_eval` as a REST compatibility
  value; it is mapped declaratively to `ExperimentRequested` and is not a tool
  init or Go package.

Status: profile-first wording was addressed by `agent-core-9ilp.2`; application
ownership and generic-tool decomposition were completed by GH-888.

## Tool Declaration File Layout

Source evidence:
- Active profiles use `tool_config_dirs` pointing at individual declaration
  directories such as `tools/builtin/` and `tools/exec/`.
- Aggregate files such as `tools/builtin.yaml` and `tools/exec.yaml` remain in
  the repository as compatibility or historical aggregate inputs.

Documentation drift:
- Several docs still present `tools/builtin.yaml` and `tools/exec.yaml` as the
  primary declaration files (`tool-selection-format.yaml`,
  `tool-declaration-format.yaml`, `tool-vocabulary-audit.yaml`, older comments
  in agent tool selection files). Those references should distinguish active
  profile directory loading from compatibility aggregate files.

Recommended edits:
- Update active config-format docs to prefer `tool_config_dirs` and individual
  declaration directories.
- Keep aggregate YAML references only where explicitly describing compatibility,
  migration history, or historical examples.

Status: addressed by `agent-core-9ilp.2`.

## Package And Metrics Counts

Source evidence:
- `go list ./...` reports 29 Go packages.
- `git ls-files '*.yaml'` reports 189 tracked YAML files.
- `package-layout.md` currently lists 29 Go packages and still matches the
  package count.

Documentation drift:
- The old verification baseline in this inventory listed 188 YAML files and
  referred to `agent-core-5zdu`.
- Other generated count references should be refreshed only if `mage stats`
  changes after the current README/docs updates.

Recommended edits:
- Keep `package-layout.md` unless `go list ./...` changes.
- Refresh generated counts in docs that quote YAML or stats totals during the
  verification follow-up.

Status: verified by `agent-core-9ilp.4`; `package-layout.md` remains aligned
with the 29-package `go list ./...` result.

## User-Facing CLI Help Note

Source evidence:
- `cmd/agent/main.go` top-level `Long` help still says modes are selected by
  `--machine` and `--tools`, while current docs and source behavior prefer
  `--profile`.

Documentation drift:
- This is source user-facing help rather than a docs/ file, so it is outside
  the "align documentation to source code" follow-up unless the team treats CLI
  help as documentation.

Recommended follow-up:
- Consider a source/documentation cleanup issue to update CLI help to the
  profile-first wording. Do not block the docs-only alignment epic on it unless
  the scope expands to user-facing strings in source.
