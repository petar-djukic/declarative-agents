# Declarative Decomposition Audit -- 2026-08-13

Register for recurring audit GH-1580. The audit examines production Go against
the repository's own thesis: agent-visible workflow behavior belongs in
declarative machines interpreted by `agent-core/cmd/agent`, not in bespoke
imperative orchestration.

This file is this run's durable output. Accepted findings are filed as separate
issues. Rejected candidates from GH-1395 are carried forward below; a later
recurrence must not refile them without new evidence.

Prior register: `agent-core/docs/specs/audits/declarative-decomposition-audit-2026-08.md`
(GH-1395). Remediations for that run closed under epic GH-1582 (PR #1601).

## Scope and gate

The eight-question gate is the one in GH-1580: contract scope, behavioral
equivalence, provisioning, existing tests, declarative visibility, compatibility
spike, exception accuracy, and net value. A candidate that fails any applicable
question is recorded as a rejected candidate, not filed.

Excluded from production decomposition findings: `magefiles/`, `_test.go`,
generated code, fixtures, and test-support packages. Test-only orchestration is
out of scope unless the harness itself is the product under audit.

Previous runs: GH-417 (2026-07-25), GH-890 (2026-07-27), GH-1105 (2026-08-03),
GH-1395 (2026-08-10). GH-1410 recorded that the GH-1105 externalization
heuristic was over-broad; this run uses the rewritten gate.

## Coverage

Production Go under audit, from `mage stats` plus a per-package line count
(excluding `_test.go`, `magefiles/`, `testdata/`):

| Module | Production Go lines | Delta vs GH-1395 |
|---|---|---|
| `agent-core` | 46,400 | +825 |
| `applications/catalog` | 1,741 | 0 |
| `applications/prose-editor` | 0 | -1,197 (removed by GH-1624) |
| Total | 48,141 | -372 |

`applications/agent-architecture`, `applications/chatbot-mesh`, and
`applications/coding-agent` still ship no production Go; they are
composition-only (or agent-YAML-only) modules whose Go is confined to
`magefiles/`.

## Executable inventory

Every production `package main` outside `magefiles/`, `testdata/`, and
`_test.go`. Confirmed by searching for `^package main` across all Go files and
subtracting the excluded directories. Two production executables remain.

| Executable | Files | Classification | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent-core/cmd/agent` | 8 | Product runtime -- the interpreter | `agent-core/cmd/agent/main.go` |
| `applications/catalog/cmd/catalog-test-evidence` | 2 | Build/test support | `applications/catalog/magefiles/test_evidence.go` is the only non-test invoker |

The GH-1395 inventory also listed `applications/prose-editor/cmd/prose-editor-tracer-boundary`.
That tree is gone (GH-1624 / PR #1626). It is not a candidate on this run.

### `agent-core/cmd/agent`

The interpreter. Not a candidate: the audit's thesis is that behavior belongs in
machines this binary interprets. Eight production files, one more than GH-1395:
`child_agent_config.go` maps a parsed `ChildAgentConfig` onto `execute.Config`
(`child_agent_config.go:10-17`). That is composition-root wiring, not a second
executable. Whether the binary has absorbed workflow policy is audited under
the runtime slice (GH-1634), not here.

### `applications/catalog/cmd/catalog-test-evidence`

Build/test support. The binary forwards `go test` JSON so the
specification-critic audit profile reads Go test evidence from a stable
test-binary path (`runner.go:156-190`). Its only non-test caller is
`applications/catalog/magefiles/test_evidence.go`. It ships in no runtime image
and no agent selects it.

Rejected as a candidate under gate question 1: no agent-visible operation is
hidden, because no agent invokes it. Same disposition as GH-1395; no new
evidence.

## Declared word inventory

103 unique words are declared under `agent-core/tools/`. The set is unchanged
from GH-1395. `mage audit` now reports 103 tool declarations (was 68 on
2026-08-10) because GH-1525 taught the corpus loader to traverse `includes:`
and subdirectory files (`pkg/spec/tool_declaration_loading.go:49-59`). Every
row below therefore reaches the audited corpus.

`invoke_llm` remains a per-profile declaration (`tools/builtin.yaml:30-32`),
not a shared `agent-core/tools` word. Profile-local LLM and application words
are not duplicated here; later slices name them when a package implements
them.

### Corpus coverage

GH-1525 HELD. `discoverAndParseToolDeclarations` loads `tools/builtin.yaml`,
`tools/exec.yaml`, then every YAML file under `tools/builtin/` and
`tools/exec/`, following `includes:` recursively
(`tool_declaration_loading.go:16-40, 49-59`). The 34-word gap recorded in
GH-1395 is closed. `mage audit` reports 103 declarations, matching this
inventory.

Names that still appear in both an aggregator (`tools/builtin.yaml` /
`tools/exec.yaml`) and a leaf file are a load-order question for the tool-package
slice (prior GH-1547 / GH-1562), not a baseline executable finding.

## MachineSpec expressiveness baseline

What the machine format can express today. A decomposition finding that needs a
construct absent from this list must be filed as an expressiveness gap against
the format rather than routed around in Go.

Source of truth: `agent-core/docs/specs/config-formats/machine-format.yaml`
and `agent-core/internal/runtime/core/machine.go`.

| Construct | Support | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| States with meaning and terminal run status | Yes | `machine.go:16-31`, `machine_state_spec.go:8-12` |
| Declared signals with trigger metadata | Yes | `machine.go:28`, `machine.go:33-40` |
| Transition table keyed by state and signal | Yes | `machine.go:125-140` |
| Named tool action | Yes | `machine-format.yaml:317-322` |
| LLM-selected dynamic dispatch (`$tool`) | Yes | `machine-format.yaml:324-330` |
| Terminal transition with no action | Yes | `machine-format.yaml:332-336` |
| Command-state step labels for stable addressing | Yes | `machine.go:134`, `machine-format.yaml:373-407` |
| Parameter sources via `$from(label).path` selectors | Yes | `machine-format.yaml:281-291` |
| Data-driven iteration (`for_each`) over selected items | Yes | `iterator_spec.go:16-25` |
| Bounded parallel iteration with `max_concurrency` | Yes | `iterator_spec.go:19-20`, `machine-format.yaml:298-300` |
| Fork-join with all-success/partial/failed/empty outcomes | Yes | `iterator_spec.go:27-40` |
| Iterator failure policy (`fail_fast`, `collect_all`) | Yes | `iterator_spec.go:21`, `machine-format.yaml:301-304` |
| Checkpoint and resume across iteration | Yes | `machine-format.yaml:356-362` |
| Budgets: iterations, tokens, duration, parse errors | Yes | `machine.go:97-103` |
| Declared per-command timeout | Yes (new vs GH-1395) | `machine.go:101`, `machine-format.yaml:130`, `machine_policy.go:31` |
| Declared `summary_signal` | Yes (new vs GH-1395) | `machine.go:24`, `machine-format.yaml:90-96` |
| Declared `resume_signal` | Yes (new vs GH-1395) | `machine.go:25`, `machine-format.yaml:98-104` |
| Transition `report_output` selector | Yes (new vs GH-1395) | `machine.go:135`, `machine-format.yaml:252-259` |
| Transition `summary` flag | Yes (new vs GH-1395) | `machine.go:136`, `machine-format.yaml:260-268` |
| Parse-retry routing with exhaustion signal | Yes | `report_parse_error` emits `BudgetExhausted` |
| Phase-scoped tool availability derived from transitions | Yes | `machine-format.yaml:410-442` |
| Static diagnostics for dead grammar | Yes | `machine-format.yaml:510-528` |
| Diagnostics for implicit summary/resume/timeout | Yes (new vs GH-1395) | `machine_diagnostics.go:16-18` |
| Workflow metric labels | Parsed and validated; format spec still `status: planned` | `machine.go:21,138`, `metric_config.go:71-80`, `machine-format.yaml:60-68,444-445` |
| Expressions, mutation, or dynamic action names | No, by design | `machine-format.yaml:369-371` |
| Nested programs inside `for_each` | No, by design | `machine-format.yaml:369-371` |

GH-1558 asked the format to declare six interpreter decisions. Five of those
fields now exist (`summary_signal`, `resume_signal`, `command_timeout`,
`report_output`, `summary`). Whether Go still applies undeclared fallbacks when
the fields are omitted is a runtime-slice question (GH-1634), not a format gap.

## Summary

This run re-audits production Go after the GH-1582 remediations and the
GH-1624 prose-editor removal. Slice sections below are filled as each
sub-issue completes.

| Slice | Issue | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | GH-1630 | executables, declarations, format | complete |
| REST and service | GH-1631 | `internal/tools/rest`, `internal/tools/service` | complete |
| Remaining tools | GH-1632 | ten focused tool packages | complete |
| Runtime and root | GH-1634 | runtime, cmd, support | complete |
| Spec and planning | GH-1633 | `pkg/spec`, `internal/planning` | complete |
| Telemetry and model | GH-1635 | evaluation, OTLP, observability, model | complete |
| Applications | GH-1636 | catalog Go and consolidation | complete |

## Accepted findings

Filed by this audit.

| Issue | Axis | Target | Hidden contract boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| GH-1637 | visibility | `internal/tools/control`, planner `invoke_executor` | Declared object schema (`exit_code`, `stdout`, …) that `self_invoke` never emits; output is raw child stdout |

## Rejected candidates

Carried forward from GH-1395. This run reconfirmed the baseline row for
`catalog-test-evidence`. Later slices may append new rows; they must not
delete a carried row without new evidence.

Candidates considered and not filed, with the gate question each failed. A
later recurrence should not refile these without new evidence.

| Candidate | Slice | Failed question | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Move `catalog-test-evidence` behind a declared word | Baseline | Q1 contract scope | Build/test support with no agent caller; its only non-test invoker is a Mage target. Excluded by the scope boundary. |
| Lower non-CIDR REST client operations to a `curl` exec word | REST/service | Q2 behavioral equivalence | GH-1385, already judged defective. Typed transport, the credential-scope gate (`client_target.go:195-214`), secret redaction out of error text (`client_response.go:238-251`), traceparent injection, and the staged error taxonomy do not survive a CLI boundary. |
| Replace the Go mock HTTP server with a bound mock CLI | REST/service | Q2 behavioral equivalence | GH-1386, already judged defective. `mock.go` is the srd039 fixture surface, loaded at server launch so a malformed fixture fails the launch. |
| Split `rest_server_stop` because it shuts down and drains | REST/service | Q1 contract scope | One shutdown transaction with one rollback boundary (relaunch). Drain counts are reporting, not a second selectable operation. |
| Decompose `doWithRetry` into machine states | REST/service | Q1 contract scope | Same-request transport retry inside one protocol transaction, sanctioned by srd028 R5.8 and the GH-1379 resolution. The cancellation defect is filed as GH-1529; the decomposition reading is not supported. |
| Decompose `awaitMatching` and `waitAnySource` loops | REST/service | Q1 contract scope | A single wait for one matching event, parking non-matching events so another filter can see them. No delay and no repeated domain operation. |
| Treat `handleMachineRequest` running a nested machine as hidden orchestration | REST/service | Q1 contract scope | This is the declarative answer, not a violation: the handler runs the MachineSpec the endpoint declares, and `validateMachineResponses` rejects a response map the machine cannot produce. |
| Treat the monitor view packages as an Article D4 violation | REST/service | Q7 exception accuracy | D4 governs documentation and never names monitor. The surface is specified by srd033 G1-G6, every view is a read, and which endpoints exist is profile config. The view vocabulary being a closed Go enum is noted but is the same pattern as every other closed set in the package. |
| Decompose the SIGTERM/bounded-wait/SIGKILL walk in `child.stop` | REST/service | Q1 contract scope | One atomic termination walk. |
| Externalize scenario directory traversal in `discovery.go` | REST/service | Q2 behavioral equivalence | Traversal inside one atomic discovery word. Same shape as GH-1384, already reversed. |
| Drive the serving-profile conformance harness through rest and service words | REST/service | Q1 contract scope | GH-1388, already judged defective. Replacing an independent observer with the system under test's own words makes conformance circular. |
| Replace `runOneValidator`'s child-agent spawn with a CLI | REST/service | Q2 behavioral equivalence | One process run plus result mapping through the shared `execute.RunAgent` path. The typed `ValidatorOutcome`, timeout enforcement, and OTLP endpoint propagation have no equivalent. |
| Split the twelve-way `init` switch in either package's `ExecuteContext` | REST/service | Q1 contract scope | `init` is bound per-ToolDef at factory time and is not agent-selectable. Standard builtin-registry shape. |
| Split `collect_scenario_verdict`, reused by four ToolDefs | REST/service | Q1 contract scope | The config selects reason text, not a distinct domain operation. All four record exactly one verdict, and each is separately declared with an `overlaps` note. |
| Move `compose` composition into MachineSpec | Tool packages | Q1 contract scope | It renders one template into one output and emits one signal. The alternative is the `carry_forward` chain srd038 replaced. |
| Convert `render_each` into a machine `for_each` | Tool packages | Q1 contract scope | It renders one string from one resolved array and dispatches nothing. `for_each` exists to dispatch a word per item, a different operation. |
| Split `read`'s `raw` flag or `read_resource`'s four modes | Tool packages | Q1 contract scope | Both select output format for one document read, not a distinct domain operation. The undeclared `raw` parameter is filed as a declaration gap in GH-1543. |
| Externalize `list_files`'s bash program | Tool packages | Q2 behavioral equivalence | Recorded exception at `list-files.yaml:143-148` from GH-1376, and re-litigating traversal externalization is what GH-1410 reversed. |
| Externalize `read` to `sed`/`nl`/`file` | Tool packages | Q8 net value | GH-1392 measured it: 0.13 ms/op in-process against a 2.1 ms/op single-fork floor, roughly 15x, paid on the highest-frequency word in a coding loop. Recorded exception at `read.yaml:79-89`. |
| Split `edit`'s `count != 1` branch | Tool packages | Q1 contract scope | Internal precondition validation on one atomic replacement; both outcomes are `ToolFailed` with different text. |
| Decompose `delay` into machine states | Tool packages | Q1 contract scope | One bounded, cancellation-aware wait with two declared outcomes. The machine already owns the retry loop -- srd040 R2.2 assigns the probe/delay/retry/timeout branches to MachineSpec, and the declaration says so. This is the pattern working. |
| Treat `self_invoke` as hidden child-tool dispatch | Tool packages | Q1 contract scope | One child agent process through the shared `execute.RunAgent` path, mapped to one signal. It dispatches no tools; the child's own machine does. Its declaration is wrong (GH-1544); its contract is not. |
| Split `invoke_llm`'s prompt assembly, history, or seed resolution | Tool packages | Q1 contract scope | `design-patterns/06-inference-boundary.md:35,39,56,114` places all of it behind one dispatch by design. One POST `/api/chat` per dispatch, no probe, no retry. |
| Split `value_predicate`, `partition`, or `select_subset` | Tool packages | Q1 contract scope | One comparison or membership test per dispatch. Multiple output arrays and multiple outcome signals are one result and its routing, not separable operations. |
| Split `validate_specs` into graph build and charter execution | Tool packages | Q1 contract scope | Two pure functions over an already-loaded corpus, with no independent outcome, no separate signal, and no branch between them. |
| Treat `load_corpus` lowering three charter kinds as compound | Tool packages | Q1 contract scope | The design assigns it: `jurist-charter-format.yaml:35-37,43-44`. Its undeclared *output* is a real defect (GH-1543); its contract scope is the specified one. |
| Lower the remaining `reduce_*` YAML evaluation to `yq`/`jq` | Tool packages | Q6 compatibility spike | Documented exception at `jurist-charter-format.yaml:43-50`, and GH-1101 permitted a Go reducer where line provenance cannot survive the CLI contract. Provenance needs `yaml.Node` positions, which value extraction discards. |
| Treat per-role factory family names as an Article D4 violation | Tool packages | Q7 exception accuracy | D4 governs documentation and Go binaries, not internal wiring struct fields. The families are init-name groups in one binary and every word stays profile-selected. The real defect in that file is list drift (GH-1548). |
| Externalize catalog's YAML loader | Tool packages | Q2 behavioral equivalence | Not attempted; same class as GH-1384. |
| "The dispatch loop is imperative Go" | Runtime | Q1 contract scope | The interpreter is supposed to be imperative. Only decisions a declaration should have made are findings. |
| Decompose the `for_each` join count-to-signal rules | Runtime | Q1 contract scope | The signal names are declared and validated; the aggregation rule is documented `for_each` semantics, not per-workflow policy. |
| Decompose the parallel worker pool, channels, and WaitGroup | Runtime | Q1 contract scope | `max_concurrency` is declared and validated. This is the bounded-parallelism implementation GH-1095 asked for. |
| Externalize the `DiagnoseMachineSpec` reachability walk | Runtime | Q1 contract scope | Static validation is a named benefit of the Machine Interpreter pattern. |
| Externalize the output-redaction path walk | Runtime | Q1 contract scope | Paths come from the tool's `Result.Redaction`; core only applies them. |
| Move Dolt SQL out of the checkpoint adapter | Runtime | Q1 contract scope | Adapter implementation behind the `Checkpoint` port, containing no state or signal literals. The terminal predicate is injected from the spec. |
| Treat `sql.Register("dolt", ...)` as a leak | Runtime | Q1 contract scope | Nineteen lines of textbook composition-root wiring. |
| Treat the `/opt/agent-core` prefix as policy | Runtime | Q1 contract scope | A deployment path constant, not workflow policy. |
| Treat `exec/procgroup.go` as a surviving duplicate | Runtime | Q1 contract scope | It is now a 27-line delegating alias, which is what GH-1393 asked for. A thin named seam is not a duplicate. The real residual is GH-1556. |
| Treat `os.ReadFile` of the machine and request file as externalizable | Runtime | Q1 contract scope | Interpreter preflight, the same carve-out GH-884 made for `--validate-config`. |
| Decompose `LoadCorpus`'s seven discovery passes | Spec/planning | Q1 contract scope | No independently meaningful intermediate: a corpus missing its use cases is not a state any machine routes on. Three declared words already own the load boundary (`load_corpus`, `load_test_suites`, `load_graph`). |
| Decompose `BuildGraph`'s six node and eleven edge passes | Spec/planning | Q1 contract scope | Pure in-memory construction of one artifact behind `validate_specs`. There is no partial graph a machine wants. |
| Decompose `Validate`'s 36 sequential checkers | Spec/planning | Q1 contract scope | Not a sequence of effects -- 36 independent pure functions over one graph, already individually selectable *from YAML* via charter `checks:`. The declarative selection the gate asks for exists. |
| Decompose `ExecuteCharters`' dispatch by check kind | Spec/planning | Q1 contract scope | The opposite of hidden workflow: three of four kinds deliberately return nil so the machine executes them as visible `rg`/scan states, with the reason written down at `charter_execute.go:39-48`. |
| Decompose finding sort/filter/format | Spec/planning | Q1 contract scope | Pure presentation over an in-memory slice, behind `format_report`. |
| Restructure the `Build*Plans`/`Reduce*` pairs | Spec/planning | Q1 contract scope | Already the target shape: lower policy to a plan, let the machine run the external search, reduce the captured output. `BuildGrepSearchPlans` explicitly does not read target files; `ReduceGrepSearch` explicitly never opens them. |
| Externalize Go-test evidence resolution (886 lines) | Spec/planning | Q1 contract scope | The profile already owns `go list` and `go test` as declared exec words; this is schema-aware reduction of their output. |
| Externalize `parse.go`'s YAML node walking or the `yaml_path` selector engine | Spec/planning | Q1 contract scope | Parsers. The charter queries are already declarative; making the interpreter declarative is not the goal. |
| Externalize `pkg/spec` discovery I/O to `find` | Spec/planning | Q2 behavioral equivalence | Same class as GH-1384. |
| Split `load_graph` because it loads a corpus and builds a graph | Spec/planning | Q1 contract scope | No machine can route on a loaded-but-ungraphed corpus, there is no sibling `build_graph` word, and the word exists to stop the machine dereferencing a nil graph. |
| Refile the stale `extract-all.yaml` / `execute-task.yaml` / `assemble-prompt.yaml` filenames | Spec/planning | No defect | The filenames are stale after GH-1088/1089/1091 but the contents were rewritten to declare the current words. No orphaned declaration exists. |
| Externalize the spool query and analytics engine to duckdb | Telemetry | Q2, Q3, Q4, Q6 -- all four | GH-1382's proposal. Not attempted, and not attemptable: duckdb is in no runtime image the audit could name, and the deterministic exemplar ordering, the divergence tie-break, the half-open duration-bucket rule with an overflow bucket, the `skipped_lines` malformed-line accounting, and the rotated-file discovery order are behavioral contracts that 34 existing tests assert directly. No equivalence matrix exists for any of them. |
| Delete `load_otlp_batch` as "cat" | Telemetry | Q1 contract scope | Not a byte copy: the protobuf-JSON decode *is* the trust-boundary check that makes a batch safe to hand to `relay_spans` (srd042 R3.10), and its separate `BatchLoaded` signal is what lets a machine distinguish a read/decode failure from an export failure. |
| Externalize spool writing and rotation to `stdouttrace` or an otelcol file exporter | Telemetry | Q6 compatibility spike | GH-1382 and GH-1387 combined. The spool word converts an *inbound protobuf* request into the stdout shape; `stdouttrace` serializes an *outbound SDK* span. No supported path exists between them without reconstructing SDK span objects, and the sort-stable attribute ordering and homogeneous-array typing are test-asserted. No provisioning answer for otelcol. |
| Collapse the evaluator's trace reader onto `tracetest.SpanStub` | Telemetry | Q6 compatibility spike | GH-1387 verbatim, already reversed. `eval_trace.go` is a deliberately partial, tolerant reader of *child agent* trace files whose producer version is not pinned to the evaluator's. Decoding into a versioned upstream struct would make an SDK bump a silent zero-span parse -- the exact failure GH-1387 was reversed for. |
| Probe Ollama through its CLI, or restore a preflight probe | Telemetry | Q2 behavioral equivalence | GH-1389, reversed: the CLI does not consume the profile's resolved `provider_url`. GH-1375 moved the probe to a declared REST word that does. The correct residual is deleting the unreachable `checkModel` (GH-1574), not re-adding a probe. |
| Externalize spool file discovery to `find` or `ls` | Telemetry | Q2 behavioral equivalence | Portable `os.Stat` inside one atomic read word. Same shape as GH-1384. |
| Split `await_spans` because it waits, decodes, and computes metadata | Telemetry | Q1 contract scope | One queue read producing one result. The metadata is projection of the batch it just took, and each field is declared. Three outcome signals is routing, not compounding. |
| Split `otlp_receiver_launch` because it binds a listener and registers two services | Telemetry | Q1 contract scope | One listener serving two OTLP signals on one port, as the declaration says. One bind, one rollback boundary. |
| Split `spool_spans` into encode and append | Telemetry | Q1 contract scope | Encoding is the append's payload. No state between them and no signal a machine could route on. |
| Decompose the receiver's overflow policy or the graceful-then-force stop walk | Telemetry | Q1 contract scope | GH-1382 recorded the overflow half as an exception because back-pressure is coupled to the machine's consumption rate. The stop is one bounded termination walk, the same shape already rejected for `child.stop`. |
| Treat the `provider != "ollama"` rejection as a closed set leaked into Go | Telemetry | Q7 exception accuracy | The documented adapter contract: `06-inference-boundary.md:112` says a new provider requires a new adapter behind the existing interface. A rejected unknown provider is the boundary working. |
| Treat the four standard dispatch metrics as policy in Go | Telemetry | Q1 contract scope | Runtime-owned dispatch instrumentation, explicitly modeled as such, and tool-supplied bindings extend it through `RecorderConfig.Bindings`. The mechanism for profile-supplied metrics exists and is used. |
| Treat `internal/observability` as carrying an application-specific concern | Telemetry | Q7 exception accuracy | Same rigor as the REST monitor question, same answer. `telemetry` is OTel setup and W3C traceparent, `tracing` is a four-method port plus a noop, `genai` is a semconv constant table, `monitor` is a schema-validated store whose vocabulary comes from `RecorderConfig`. The two application-flavored `Snapshot` booleans are dead code (GH-1574), not a D4 violation. |
| Treat the OTLP and monitor timeout/limit defaults as policy leaks | Telemetry | Q1 contract scope | Each is a fallback for a value the declaration exposes and the shipped declarations set. A declared knob with a Go default is the pattern working -- which is why GH-1570's ten-minute point timeout *is* filed: it is not exposed in the config block at all. |
| Drive the serving-profile conformance harness through rest and service words | Applications | Q1 contract scope | GH-1388, already reversed. Replacing the independent process/HTTP observer with the system under test's own words makes conformance circular and discards the process-death watchdog at `conformance/serve.go:136-140`, `:180-193`. The file states this itself at `:29-32`. |
| Audit `conformance/harness.go`, `otel.go`, `dolt.go`, `ollama.go` | Applications | Q1 contract scope | Test-support harness; the harness is not the product under audit. Every entry point takes `*testing.T`. |
| Audit `catalogroot/root.go` and `agentbuild/build.go` | Applications | Q1 contract scope | Build/test support. `catalogroot` has only magefile callers; `agentbuild` is one `go build` shared by a magefile and the harness. |
| Externalize the prose-editor tracer boundary | Applications | Q5 declarative visibility, inverted | Already bound as six atomic exec ToolDefs. GH-1575 and GH-1576 refine *what* crosses the boundary; they do not propose replacing it. |
| Replace the `serve` fixture double inside the tracer binary | Applications | Q2 behavioral equivalence | The deterministic model and RAG stub for a hermetic gate, invoked only from `magefiles/integration_tracer.go:512`. No equivalence or provisioning story for replacing it. Its co-location with product code is noted in GH-1578, not filed as decomposition. |
| Externalize the prose-editor tracer boundary | Baseline | Q5 declarative visibility, inverted | Already bound declaratively as six atomic exec ToolDefs with declared side effects, reversibility, and undo. |
| Treat the tool-contract completeness gap as a decomposition finding | Baseline | Q1 contract scope | A validation-coverage defect, not hidden workflow. Filed as GH-1525 and carried as repository work in this epic. |

### Defective findings from GH-1105 -- never refile

GH-1410 reviewed the merged remediation of the 2026-08-03 run and identified
these as defective. They are recorded so a later recurrence recognizes a repeat
proposal.

| Issue | Proposal | Why it was wrong |
|---|---|---|
| GH-1382 | Externalize OTLP spool query to duckdb and rotation to otelcol | Dependencies absent from the runtime images; equivalence for the spool contract never demonstrated. |
| GH-1384 | Externalize directory traversal to `find` | Replaced portable `os.ReadDir` with undeclared `exec.Command("find")`, which is not declarative externalization and cost portability. |
| GH-1385 | Lower non-CIDR REST client operations to a `curl` exec word | Typed transport, security policy, receipts, and error taxonomy do not survive the substitution. |
| GH-1386 | Replace the Go mock HTTP server with a bound mock CLI | Fixture compatibility not established; the mock is test support. |
| GH-1387 | Decode conformance traces with the upstream `SpanStub` type | Added an OTel SDK dependency and 200+ lines while still mirroring the wire format and silently skipping drifted spans. |
| GH-1388 | Drive the serving-profile conformance harness through rest and service words | Replaces an independent observer with the system under test's own words, making conformance circular. |
| GH-1389 | Probe Ollama through the CLI | The CLI does not consume the profile's resolved `provider_url`, so the probe would not test the configured endpoint. |

## Enforcement of the ToolDef contract

Produced by the remaining-tools slice (GH-1632). `ToolDef` still has 29
exported fields (`catalog/tooldef.go:25-53`). The 2026-08-10 counts (12 / 9 /
12 / 8, overlapping) are stale: GH-1525 taught the corpus loader to traverse
includes, and `spec.Validate` now runs selected-tool completeness
(`validate.go:41`, `checkSelectedToolContractCompleteness`). Ordinary
`cmd/agent` startup still does not call `ValidateToolContracts`
(`main.go:365-369`); full six-section completeness remains authoring and
specification-audit work, as the Tool Contract pattern says.

What is guaranteed before a word can be dispatched: it has a name; its type is
one of three; a builtin has an `init` resolving to a registered factory; an
exec word has a binary; every `$from` selector parses; the precondition is a
known gate; the metric config is well-formed; every named machine action is
selected; a parse-retry budget is completely routed; every declared emitted
signal has a routable successor; visibility, reversibility classification, and
undo strategy are known tokens; phases are machine states; and a word declared
reversible-with-mutation has some non-`noop` undo string.

`ValidateToolEmits` still compares declaration to the machine, not
implementation to declaration. That is why GH-1637 could land after GH-1543
closed.

Authoring-only fields (never read by the production runtime): `Category`,
`Contract`, `Problem`, `Goals`, `Requirements`, `NonGoals`, `Errors`,
`Relationships`, `Undo.Payload`, `Reversibility.RequiresConfirmation`.
`Output.Schema` is presence-checked in catalog contract helpers that startup
does not invoke.

## The loop decision table

Produced by the runtime slice (GH-1634). Every decision the dispatch loop and
the composition root make that is not read from the loaded MachineSpec,
classified as interpreter mechanism (legitimate) or workflow policy (a
finding). GH-1558's fields now exist; the remaining policy is the documented
fallback when those fields are omitted, not new hidden orchestration.

The two 2026-08-10 composition-root policy rows (hardcoded `AgentName`,
tool-name `OnResult`) are gone. Residuals concentrate in fallbacks.

### Policy (residuals of GH-1551 / GH-1552 / GH-1555 / GH-1558)

| Decision | Evidence | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal run status inferred from state spelling when `run_status` is omitted | `loop.go:144-153` | GH-1551 PARTIAL |
| Summary signal defaults to `TaskCompleted` | `loop_runner.go:98-106` | GH-1552 / GH-1558 PARTIAL |
| CLI overwrites the summary from any non-empty output when the machine declares neither `summary_signal` nor `summary: true` | `main.go:670-677` | GH-1552 PARTIAL |
| Suspend keyed on the signal `AwaitApproval` | `loop_runner.go:406-407` | GH-1558 PARTIAL |
| Resume defaults the re-entry signal to `Approved` | `resume.go:57-60,100-105`; `main.go:113` | GH-1558 PARTIAL |
| Default budget `MaxIterations: 100` in Go | `main.go:656-658` | GH-1558 PARTIAL |
| Omitted `command_timeout` means no per-dispatch timer | `machine_policy.go:10-16`; `dispatch.go:78-84` | GH-1555 PARTIAL |

`state.go` still returns a magic `State("Failed")` for an unhandled pair; the
caller discards it and uses `r.state` (`loop_runner.go:196-205`). Inert; not
filed. Diagnostics fire for implicit summary, resume, timeout, max iterations,
and missing `run_status` (`machine_policy.go:59-87`). That is warned
compatibility, not removal of the Go decision.

### Mechanism (legitimate interpreter)

Empty start signal → `Seed` / `"Begin."`; cancelled context →
`StatusCancelled`; budget trip → `BudgetExhausted`; `Err` / timeout / cancel /
panic → `CommandError`; `for_each` join count-to-signal (names from the spec);
the parallel worker pool; `DiagnoseMachineSpec` reachability; output-redaction
path walk; Dolt SQL behind the Checkpoint port; `sql.Register("dolt")`;
`/opt/agent-core`; `os.ReadFile` of machine and request files; process-group
kill on cancel; `--request` as Seed bytes; `$request.<field>` grammar. None of
these are refiled.

## Slice sections

Each audit slice appends its section below.

### Baseline -- GH-1630

Complete. Rebuilt the executable inventory, the declared-word inventory, and
the expressiveness baseline above. Filed no decomposition findings: the two
production executables are the interpreter and a build/test-support shim, and
neither passes the gate as hidden orchestration. The third GH-1395 executable
was removed with the prose-editor application.

GH-1525 HELD: the corpus loader traverses subdirectory declarations and
`includes:`, and `mage audit` reports 103 words, matching this inventory.

The format now declares the GH-1558 summary, resume, timeout, and
report-output fields. Workflow metric labels parse and validate in Go while
the format spec still marks them planned; that status lag is recorded in the
expressiveness table for the runtime slice rather than filed here, because no
agent-visible operation is hidden.

### REST and service -- GH-1631

Complete. Re-read every production file in `internal/tools/rest` (8,777 lines)
and `internal/tools/service` (1,625 lines). Eleven REST inits and eleven
service inits; each is one agent-visible contract. Sequencing that used to
hide in Go -- send/await, health retry, mock and validator iteration, per-child
teardown -- is owned by MachineSpec. The scenario-critic machine is the
exemplar: `for_each` starts mocks, a REST word probes subject health, and
emergency edges call `stop_all_services`.

All nine prior findings HELD:

| Issue | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| GH-1528 | HELD | `sendAsync` calls `executeRequest` on the dispatch goroutine and returns `RESTAccepted` with a receipt (`client_async.go:15-48`). No `go completeAsync`. |
| GH-1529 | HELD | `clientCmd` implements `ExecuteContext`; requests use `http.NewRequestWithContext`; retry sleeps on `request.Context()` (`client_command.go:105-146`, `client_request.go:52`). |
| GH-1530 | HELD | `validateClientEmits` / `validateServerAwaitEmits` / `validateAwaitAnyEmits` run at factory build (`emits_validation.go:13-25`, `factories.go:394-436`). |
| GH-1531 | HELD | Await undo is `queue_event_restore`; declared output keys match runtime (`tools/builtin/rest/all.yaml`; `TestRESTDeclaredOutputPropertiesExistAtRuntime`). |
| GH-1532 | HELD | Lifecycle-control requests go through `authorizeLifecycleRequest`; empty auth ref is loopback-only (`server_routes.go:150-161`, `server_auth.go:20-39`). |
| GH-1533 | HELD | `stop_all_services` exists; `preparedRun.Close` calls `state.Reap()` (`factories.go:31,36-41`, `cmd/agent/main.go:312-313`). |
| GH-1534 | HELD | Subject health route is parsed before `Start`; `RecordSubject` runs only after a successful start (`scenario_steps.go:173-209`). |
| GH-1535 | HELD | Health fields and `exhausted` are declared; verdict words no longer emit impossible `CommandError`. |
| GH-1536 | HELD | `start_service` / `list_scenarios` inits are gone. `TestServiceDeclarationsMatchStandardInits` pins eleven inits to eleven ToolDefs. |

No new finding passed the gate. Tempting splits that remain rejected: `doWithRetry` (same-request transport retry, srd028 R5.8), `awaitMatching` / `waitAnySource` (one wait), `handleMachineRequest` nested machine (the declarative answer), SIGTERM/wait/KILL in `child.stop` (one termination walk), curl/mock-CLI substitutions (Q2), and driving conformance through rest/service words (GH-1388). Two residuals recorded rather than filed: `CompensateFromReceipt` ignores its context (undo plumbing, not a hidden workflow), and `lifecycle_control.action` still accepts tokens the runtime does not branch on (Q1).

Tests: `go test ./internal/tools/rest/... ./internal/tools/service/...` passed (0.87s and 1.48s).

### Remaining tool packages -- GH-1632

Complete. Audited ten packages in full: catalog (2,241), filesystem (1,286), llm (1,084), validation (960), control (942), lifecycle (874), exec (588), compose (325), registry (300), undo (64).

Every exported word is atomic. Constructs that look like violations remain the pattern working: `delay` is a bounded wait whose retry loop lives in the machine; `self_invoke` is one child process; `invoke_llm` is one inference transaction; `checkpoint_rollback` is the declared atomic recovery walk.

Prior findings:

| Issue | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| GH-1539 | HELD | Walk reads `ToolSpec.Rollback` and skips declared irreversible (`receipt_rollback.go:206-208`). `CompensationRequired` is pending work, not failure (`:226-227`). Exec `commit` uses `compensating_action`. Guard: `TestRollbackViaReceiptsHonorsExecReversibilityTiers`. |
| GH-1540 | PARTIAL | Exec Undo switches on `undo.strategy` (`exec/builder.go:100-124`). Filesystem `write`/`edit` still restore from receipt without reading the strategy token (`filesystem/write.go`). Residual of the same class; not refiled. |
| GH-1541 | HELD | Visibility, reversibility classification, undo strategy, and phases fail at load/wiring (`catalog/loading.go:207-238`, `phase_validation.go:15-33`). |
| GH-1542 | HELD | `DecodeToolConfig` uses `DisallowUnknownFields` (`catalog/config.go:24-28`). |
| GH-1543 | HELD | Listed agent-core words now match. Residual catalog alias filed as GH-1637. |
| GH-1544 | HELD | Remaining `self_invoke` words are compensatable; Undo returns `CompensationRequired`. |
| GH-1545 | HELD | `context_limit` is decoded and assigned (`llm/invoke.go:315`). `manifest_state` is required. |
| GH-1546 | HELD | Plan-schema enum, Composing default, hardcoded nudge, and IssueID receipt field are gone. |
| GH-1547 | HELD | `read`/`write`/`edit`/`find` have one source. Compatibility bundles `tools/exec.yaml` vs `tools/exec/all.yaml` remain documented alternative load paths (srd023); not refiled (Q7). |
| GH-1548 | HELD | Factory catalog is probe-derived; orphaned parse-metrics helpers are gone. |
| GH-1549 | HELD | Unresolved compose selectors go to `Diagnostics`, not `Err` (`compose/compose.go:86-91`). |

One finding filed: GH-1637 (`invoke_executor` object schema vs `self_invoke` stdout string). Tempting splits remain rejected (compose→machine, render_each→for_each, list_files bash, read-to-sed, delay-as-machine, yq/jq). Remaining aggregator/leaf pairs (`tools/exec.yaml` vs leaf files; inline copies in `tools/builtin.yaml`) are documented alternative load paths (srd023) and are not refiled (Q7). GH-1584 (rollback profile rebuild) is closed and is not refiled; missing-`Reverser` skips in `undoEntry` are that issue's residual.

The ToolDef enforcement table above is refreshed: startup wiring is tighter than 2026-08-10; six-section completeness still belongs to `validate_specs` / authoring, not ordinary startup.

Tests: catalog, filesystem, llm, validation, control, lifecycle, exec, compose, and registry packages passed. `undo` has no test files.

### Runtime core and composition root -- GH-1634

Complete. Audited `internal/runtime/core` (5,532 lines, 30 files), `cmd/agent`
(2,248 lines, 8 files), and `internal/support` (443 lines, 5 files).

The interpreter is sound. The loop decision table above is the evidence: the
loop itself is mechanism, and the remaining policy is documented fallback when
a GH-1558 field is omitted. There is still no role-keyed branching in
`cmd/agent` (GH-884 HELD). Tests forbid `--validate-test-evidence` /
`--run-test-evidence`.

Prior findings:

| Issue | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| GH-1550 | HELD | Resume seeds from the last execution digest (`resume.go:81-97`). Conversation and domain snapshots fold on save (`checkpoint_snapshot.go:12-22`) and restore (`main.go:744-803`). |
| GH-1551 | PARTIAL | Declared `run_status` is preferred (`loop.go:132-141`). Spelling fallback is live (`loop.go:144-153`). Diagnostic `undeclared_terminal_status` exists (`machine_policy.go:78-85`). |
| GH-1552 | PARTIAL | Engine reads `summary_signal` then `TaskCompleted` (`loop_runner.go:98-106`) and `summary: true` (`result_reporting.go:37-53`). CLI overwrite is skipped only when the machine declares a summary (`main.go:670-677`). |
| GH-1553 | HELD | Operator output comes from transition `report_output` (`result_reporting.go:23-35`; `main.go:725-734`). No production `CommandName ==` branch in `cmd/agent`. |
| GH-1554 | HELD | `machineAgentName` reads `machine.Name` (`main.go:638-643`). Empty name still falls back to `"agent"`. |
| GH-1555 | PARTIAL | `budget.command_timeout` is parsed and passed into dispatch (`machine_policy.go:10-16`; `dispatch.go:63-67,86-97`). Omitted → duration 0 → no timer. Diagnostic `implicit_command_timeout`. |
| GH-1556 | HELD | Service children go through `subprocess.Start` (`service.go:106,235-246`). `SetProcGroup` always sets `Setpgid`, `Cancel` SIGKILL, and `WaitDelay`. `exec/procgroup.go` remains a 27-line alias (not refiled). |
| GH-1557 | HELD | `internal/support/cli` is gone. `envexpand` has tests. `SnapshotDomain` is wired. |
| GH-1558 | PARTIAL | Five fields exist. Go still applies the compatibility fallbacks in the loop table when they are omitted. |
| GH-1559 | HELD | `--request` is Seed bytes (`main.go:462-476`). Words declare `$request.<field>`. Flag help is role-neutral. |

No new finding passed the gate. Do not refile: `suspend_signal` for `AwaitApproval` (same GH-1558 residual), the 10-minute subprocess transport default (Q1), `selectsRollbackTool` keyed on `checkpoint_rollback` (composition-root wiring), or the carried interpreter-mechanism list.

Tests: `go test ./internal/runtime/core/... ./cmd/agent/... ./internal/support/...` passed (core 0.52s, cmd/agent 3.31s). `internal/support` has no test file; its subpackages pass.

### Specification and planning -- GH-1633

Complete. Audited `pkg/spec` (6,215 lines, 30 files) and `internal/planning`
(1,936 lines, 17 files).

Every major `pkg/spec` stage is the body of a machine-dispatched word in
`internal/tools/validation`. Charter `checks:` already selects checkers. No
compound stage remains in these packages.

Prior findings:

| Issue | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| GH-1560 | HELD | `extract_task` selects only (`extract_builders.go:25-43`). `mark_nodes_planning` is the only Planning mutation (`:156-170`). All three planner machines dispatch it after `TaskExtracted`. |
| GH-1561 | HELD | Factory decodes `max_weight` (`factories.go:29-31,69-79`). Zero is unlimited. `defaultMaxWeight` is gone. |
| GH-1562 | HELD | Planner words live only under `tools/builtin/planner/all.yaml`. Undo is `pipeline_state_restore`. `pipeline_graph` is rejected. Guard: `planner_declarations_test.go`. |
| GH-1563 | HELD | `checkBrokenTouchpoints` walks authored corpus touchpoints. `depends-on-violation` is not selectable. |
| GH-1564 | HELD | `spec_path_evidence.go`, `extract/output.go`, `graph/persist.go` are gone. No `os.WriteFile` in planning production. |
| GH-1565 | HELD | `format_task_file` and `format_issue` decode `path` / `body_path` / `deliverable_type` from YAML. |
| GH-1566 | HELD | YAML unmarshalers return decode errors. Type / Init / Visibility validated. Diagnostic severity defaults to error. |

No new finding passed the gate. Tempting splits remain rejected: Validate's 36 checkers (already charter-selectable), split `load_graph`, discovery I/O to `find` (Q2 / GH-1384), stale YAML filenames (no defect). Residual, not filed: `reversibility.undo` is still unread (`tool_models.go:56-59`) and belongs with GH-1541.

Tests: `go test ./pkg/spec ./internal/planning/...` passed (`pkg/spec` 6.46s; extract 0.54s, graph 0.66s, pipeline 0.82s, plan 0.96s).

### Evaluation, OTLP, observability, and model -- GH-1635

Complete. Audited `internal/evaluation` (3,733 lines), `internal/tools/otlp`
(3,849), `internal/observability` (2,076), and `internal/model` (1,278).

Every exported word is one agent-visible contract. The eleven evaluator point
words remain the cleanest family: `create_point_dir` and `sample_docs` emit
copy parameters rather than copying, and `record_point_failure` leaves
`meta.json` to `collect_metrics`. `internal/observability` is still generic
ports and stores, not application workflow.

Prior findings:

| Issue | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| GH-1567 | HELD | `ReceiverBuilder` implements `Reverser` (`receiver.go:336-340`). Launch emits a receipt. Rollback walk calls `BuildReverser().Undo`. |
| GH-1568 | HELD | `spool_get_metric` is a bounded page with `page_size`/`offset`/`total`. Residual wording: `output.description` still says "All spooled records" while the schema describes a page; not refiled. |
| GH-1569 | HELD | Factory rejects `max_bytes > 0 && max_files < 2`. Rotation errors instead of deleting the active file. |
| GH-1570 | HELD | `InitSession` errors if the grid is empty or defaults are missing. Defaults come from ToolDef config. |
| GH-1571 | HELD | Stop schema lists the five metric keys the runtime emits. Relay dropped `accepted_span_count`. |
| GH-1572 | HELD | Split into `spool_span_heatmap` and `spool_span_group_by`. Empty `group_by` is `CommandError`. |
| GH-1573 | HELD | Sample layout is ToolDef config. `run_point` declares `state_mutation` + `stderr_write` and threads the tracer. |
| GH-1574 | HELD | `checkModel` / CLI reporting / `testutil.go` are gone. Adapter is POST `/api/chat` only. |

No new finding passed the gate. Duckdb, otelcol, SpanStub, and the Ollama CLI
probe stay in the rejected register (Q2–Q4, Q6). Residuals not filed:
`run_point` Go defaults (`critic-point` / `20` / `Done`) when the critic
re-declaration is absent (Q1, declared-knob fallback class).

Tests: evaluation 1.93s, otlp 1.08s, observability subpackages, and model
subpackages passed.

### Application Go and consolidation -- GH-1636

Complete. Audited the nine non-test production Go files under
`applications/catalog` excluding `magefiles/` and testdata. Composition-only
modules `applications/chatbot-mesh`, `applications/coding-agent`, and
`applications/agent-architecture` still ship no production Go.

**The catalog module still ships no product-runtime Go.** Its files are
harness, build recipe, and root resolution:

| File | Classification | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `cmd/catalog-test-evidence/{main,runner}.go` | Build/test support | Only non-test invoker is a Mage target; Q1 reject (baseline). |
| `conformance/harness.go` | Test harness | Every entry point takes `*testing.T`. |
| `conformance/serve.go` | Independent observer | Process/HTTP watchdog; states GH-1388 itself at `:29-32`. |
| `conformance/{dolt,otel,ollama}.go` | Test-support fixtures | Harness helpers, not agent-selectable words. |
| `catalogroot/root.go` | Build/test support | Magefile callers only. |
| `agentbuild/build.go` | Build/test support | One `go build` shared by magefile and harness. |

GH-1388 remains rejected (Q1). GH-1575 through GH-1578 are **VACATED** by
GH-1624: the prose-editor tree is gone, so those findings have no residual
code to refile or re-open.

Consolidation of this run's filing: GH-1637 still passes the gate. The
declared `invoke_executor` output object is an agent-visible contract
`self_invoke` does not keep (`selfinvoke.go:98-101` vs
`planner/builtin.yaml:125-142`). Declaration-only or JSON-wrap both preserve
spawn, signals, and receipts. It stays open; this epic does not fix it.

Tests: catalog-test-evidence 0.43s, catalogroot 0.63s, agentbuild 0.75s,
conformance 64.3s.

### Run summary

Coverage against `mage stats`: 46,400 production Go lines in `agent-core`
(+825 vs GH-1395) and 1,741 in `applications/catalog` (unchanged).
Prose-editor is gone (−1,197). Total 48,141 (−372). All production packages
named in the seven slices were read.

Prior-finding tally (the 50 GH-1395 filings):

| Disposition | Count | Issues |
|---|---|---|
| HELD | 41 | GH-1525; GH-1528–1536; GH-1539; GH-1541–1549; GH-1550, 1553, 1554, 1556, 1557, 1559; GH-1560–1566; GH-1567–1574 |
| PARTIAL | 5 | GH-1540; GH-1551, 1552, 1555, 1558 |
| REGRESSED | 0 | — |
| VACATED | 4 | GH-1575–1578 (prose-editor removed by GH-1624) |

This run filed **1** finding (GH-1637, visibility) and rejected no new
candidate that was not already in the carried register. Residuals recorded
rather than filed: filesystem `undo.strategy` unread (GH-1540), GH-1558
omitted-field fallbacks, `CompensateFromReceipt` ignoring context, and
`lifecycle_control.action` unused tokens.

The rejected-candidate table and the GH-1410 defective-findings table were
copied forward in full. Later recurrences must not refile those rows without
new evidence.
