# Boundary Tool

This chapter presents the Boundary Tool pattern, which composes agents through non-terminal boundary tools. A parent machine delegates to a child agent through one tool call; the child runs its own execution and returns one signal. Each machine stays flat and independently validatable; hierarchy emerges from composition, not from nesting.

## Intent

Delegate a complete child execution through one boundary tool so every machine stays flat, independently validatable, and composable without structural coupling.


## Motivation

Chapter 2 distinguished terminal tools (atomic) from non-terminal tools (boundaries). A boundary tool's `Execute` crosses into an external actor and returns only when that actor finishes; to the parent machine it is indistinguishable from any other tool (one tool, one signal) even though an entire execution may unfold inside. Boundary kind determines the actor:

| Boundary kind | Actor | Example tool |
|---|---|---|
| None | local operation | `write_file`, `build` |
| Model | LLM provider | `invoke_llm` |
| Human | interactive UI | `rest_await_event` |
| Child process | subprocess agent | `run_agent`, `execute_task` |
| Nested machine | in-process FSM | `run_point` |

This uniformity is the composition primitive. Wiring multi-agent coordination imperatively couples parent and child. The parent must know the child's control flow. A boundary tool instead collapses the child's whole execution into a single signal, so hierarchical depth comes from stacking boundaries while each machine stays flat.


## Applicability

Boundary Tool fits when an agent must coordinate work across sub-agents or sub-machines rather than inlining their logic. Common cases are evaluation stacks (a harness running subject agents) and task decomposition (a planner delegating sub-tasks). The pattern becomes more valuable when child executions need to be independently auditable and rollbackable, and when resource authority should narrow as work is delegated downward.


## Structure

In the working implementation the canonical composition is a three-tier process stack (bench, critic, executor) shown as a deployment diagram in Fig. 24. **Bench** (human-launched) dispatches `self_invoke` to start critics; each **Critic** runs **Executors** as nested machines via `run_point`. Each tier is a separate profile with its own machine.

### Participants

#### Boundary tool

Obeys the ordinary tool contract (parameters, signal, side effects, receipt) but crosses into an actor.

#### Profile reference

Carried by the boundary tool rather than a code dependency, either `config.profile` (a child profile YAML) for subprocess children or `config.point_machine` (a sub-machine) for nested machines, so the parent sees only the profile path and parameter contract, never the child's states or tools.

#### Parent

Routes on the returned signal.

#### Child

Produces its own execution, invisible above the boundary.


## Collaborations

### Delegation

When a parent dispatches a boundary tool it starts a child execution; the child runs to completion and the boundary tool collapses its execution into one signal. The sequence diagram in Fig. 25 shows `execute_task` delegation: the parent spawns the child with a sub-task spec and a trace context, the child runs its own `agent.run`, and a single `ToolDone`/`ToolFailed` returns. The child sees only its sub-task, not the parent's context, and its execution is independently auditable and rollbackable.

|:---:|

A single benchmark point flows through all three tiers: bench launches an evaluator, the evaluator starts a nested generator that writes/builds/tests, control returns up, the evaluator classifies the run, and bench adds the trace to the grid. At every boundary the parent sees one tool and one signal; a generator's 50-iteration execution is invisible to the evaluator.

### Trace propagation

The pattern requires trace context to cross each child-execution boundary (Chapter 8). The shipped subprocess path meets that requirement: it serializes the active span as W3C `traceparent`, and the child roots its `agent.run` under the parent's boundary span while writing a separate trace file with the shared trace ID. `$tool` dispatch stays in the current machine and span context, so it needs no propagation.

Nested evaluator machines are a reference-implementation limitation, not evidence for the generic claim. The shipped `run_point` path supplies `tracing.NoopTracer{}` to the child loop. Bench-to-critic and critic-to-executor dispatch therefore execute and return structured results, but the nested point emits no spans to attach to its parent. Passing the active tracer and parent context through `run_point`, then testing the resulting parent/child span IDs, remains design intent.


## Consequences

### Benefits

#### Isolation with flat machines

Each child has its own memory, machine, and execution; complexity stays local and every machine remains independently validatable.

#### Authority attenuation

A child inherits a subset of its parent's authority. Bench's full budget narrows to an evaluator's per-run budget, then to a generator's per-point budget. Authority never increases at a boundary.

#### Trace coherence and deterministic termination

When every boundary adapter propagates context, hierarchical traces form trees that standard tools visualize. Parents independently enforce termination through budgets and timeouts, surfacing `BudgetExceeded` at the boundary.

### Liabilities

#### Coarse boundary compensation

A parent cannot call `Undo` on a child's individual tools; it can only run the child's `BoundaryCompensation` (delete the output directory, revert to the pre-child checkpoint). Fine-grained rollback inside a child requires re-entering the child's lifecycle machine, which is possible but expensive.

#### Hierarchical only

All composition flows parent-to-child; there is no peer-to-peer negotiation. Workflows that seem to need it are restructured as a parent querying both children and merging results, preserving authority, trace, and termination guarantees that unrooted peers would lack.

#### Adapter-specific trace gaps

Structural composition does not prove trace composition. Every boundary adapter needs its own propagation test; a no-op child tracer preserves dispatch semantics while silently breaking the span tree. The reference `run_point` adapter currently has this limitation.


## Implementation

### Three composition mechanisms

**Subprocess child.** The parent spawns a separate OS process (`execute_task`, `run_agent`, `self_invoke`) with its own memory and trace file. Isolation is strong; cost is spawn plus serialization. **In-process nested machine.** The parent creates a new engine in the same process and runs a sub-machine (`run_point`); near-zero overhead, weaker isolation, suited to tight inner loops. **`$tool` dispatch.** Not a boundary but a composition tool: the engine resolves the tool from an LLM result, composing tools *within* one machine with no child execution.

| Mechanism | Isolation | Overhead | Child execution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Subprocess | Process boundary | High | Separate trace file |
| Nested machine | Shared memory | Near zero | Independent nested run; evaluator currently records no child spans |
| `$tool` dispatch | Same machine | None | None |

### Profile-driven declaration

Boundary tools reference child *configuration*, not child code. Because the parent carries only a profile path, the child can change (faster model, new tool, restructured machine) without touching the parent; the same parent machine delegates to different children by parameterizing the profile path; and depth is unbounded (the profile graph is a DAG).

### Rollback at boundaries

A boundary tool's receipt encodes a coarse compensation for the whole child execution. A **reversible** child's artifacts are deleted or reverted; a **compensatable** child's external calls are corrected via stored resource identifiers; an **irreversible** child is skipped and logged. Classification propagates upward. If any child tool is irreversible, the boundary tool is at least compensatable, since coarse compensation cannot undo the irreversible step.


## Relationships in the Pattern Language

Boundary Tool sits within Machine Interpreter and requires Machine Interpreter, Tool Contract, and Transition Spans: delegation is one declared tool call, its outcome is one signal, and a complete boundary adapter links the child trace to the parent. It overlaps Inference Boundary because both govern boundary crossings, but Boundary Tool is the broader composition mechanism for child actors and sub-machines. The complete grammar is maintained in `pattern-language.yaml`.


## Known Uses

**Bench/critic/executor stack.** The evaluation harness composes three tiers (Fig. 24): bench delegates to critics via `self_invoke`, critics run executors via nested `run_point`, and a single benchmark point traverses all three with complexity isolated at each level.

**Planner/generator delegation.** A planner uses LLM inference to decompose a task, then dispatches `execute_task` per sub-task; each generator sees only its sub-task and produces an independently rollbackable execution, so a failed sub-task 3 reverts without disturbing sub-tasks 1 and 2. Security-review and migration planners reuse the mechanism with different child profiles.

**Self-invocation.** `self_invoke` re-runs the current binary under a different profile, letting one agent act as another configuration of itself without a separate deployment.

**Supervisor trees (Erlang/OTP)** [@armstrong-2003]. Processes arranged in a supervision hierarchy, where a parent starts, monitors, and restarts children, are hierarchical composition with attenuated responsibility, the reliability precedent for parent-to-child delegation.

**Actor model** [@hewitt-actor-1973]. Computation as actors that create other actors and communicate only by messages is the theoretical basis for composing isolated executions, each opaque behind its message boundary.

**MapReduce** [@dean-mapreduce-2004]. A coordinator delegates isolated sub-computations to workers and merges their results, a parent-to-child composition with results returned upward, mirroring how a bench collapses each child execution into one signal.
