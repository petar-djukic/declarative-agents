# Fragments and templates

Fragments are the smallest reuse unit: a parameterized YAML unit that a machine or declaration file instantiates with arguments. The mechanism lives in `agent-core/internal/fragments` (srd052) and substitutes `$param(name)` references at load time, so the instantiated closure remains plain YAML that `--dump-config` shows in full.

## Machine templates

A `machine.yaml` may carry `unit:` and `instantiate:` and nothing else. `applications/catalog/agents/runtime-state-reader/machine.yaml` is the shortest example — 14 lines instantiating `monitor-service-machine-template.yaml` with the profile's word names as arguments. Shipped templates live in `agent-core/tools/machines/`; applications keep local ones in `agents/units/`. Machines may instantiate but may not import: the `imports:` field is rejected with an explanatory error, which keeps every machine's full state space visible at its instantiation site.

## Declaration units

Tool declaration files (`catalog.ToolDefsFile`) compose with `unit:`, `imports:`, `params:`, `instantiate:`, and `override: true` for replacing a tool from an imported unit. `applications/chatbot-mesh/agents/chatbot/declarations.yaml` instantiates the mesh monitor fragment in two lines where other agents inline the same two tool definitions at about 120 lines.

The table lists the shared units that exist today and the ones the capability-profiles epic adds.

| Unit | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| monitor service machine template | `agent-core/tools/machines/monitor-service-machine-template.yaml` | shipped |
| serve machine template | `agent-core/tools/machines/serve-machine-template.yaml` | shipped |
| lifecycle approval machine template | `agent-core/tools/machines/lifecycle-approval-machine-template.yaml` | shipped |
| mesh monitor fragment (launch/stop pair) | `applications/chatbot-mesh/agents/units/mesh-monitor-fragment.yaml` | shipped |
| monitor control fragment (launch/await/stop trio) | `applications/catalog/agents/units/monitor-control-fragment.yaml` | shipped |
| serve-lifecycle declarations fragment | `agent-core/tools/units/serve-lifecycle-declarations-fragment.yaml` | shipped (GH-2166) |
| monitor server fragment | `agent-core/tools/rest/units/monitor-server-fragment.yaml` | shipped (GH-2167) |

## REST definitions

`rest.yaml` composes exactly as a declarations file does: `unit:`, `imports:` and `instantiate:` are implemented in the REST definition loader and enforce the srd052 rules. The canonical monitor server ships at `agent-core/tools/rest/units/monitor-server-fragment.yaml`, and an agent instantiates it with its address, limits profile and queue name.

Two rules shape where that instantiation goes. An instantiation none of whose produced definitions a closure selects is an unused import (srd052 R3.1), so a server cannot be instantiated in a `rest.yaml` that a request profile also loads — the request machine launches no monitor server. The instantiation therefore lives in a `monitor-rest.yaml` that only the agent's own profile lists. And a mapping name is never substituted (R2.3), so the fragment produces a server under a fixed name; an agent whose server takes another name instantiates it under `as`, which prefixes every produced name including the endpoints.

## When to make a fragment

We cut a fragment when the same block appears in a third place, or in a second repository. The reuse statistics (`mage stats:reuse`, [declaration-statistics.md](declaration-statistics.md)) surface the candidates: duplication and ceremony scores identify blocks that repeat, and the files-per-change table identifies wiring that a fragment would collapse to one instantiate line. A fragment takes parameters for what varies and nothing else; a fragment with many parameters is usually two fragments.
