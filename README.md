# Declarative Agents

Profile-driven runtime and design patterns for declarative, tool-augmented LLM agents: an agent is a YAML profile, interpreted by one Go runtime.

Most agent frameworks bind workflow logic to the code, so any loop change forces a binary rebuild. The YAML profile defines the agent — its tools, states, transitions, signals, budgets — and a single runtime executes whatever loop it receives. Altering the workflow is a configuration edit; a new agent needs no new binary. The companion white paper, *Design Patterns for Declarative Agents*, lists eleven patterns for building dependable agents this way.

## Quickstart

The quickest start is a packaged application from [`applications/`](applications/) — every subdirectory there is a runnable composition. This one starts the canonical documentation-curator and serves its UI, with Go and Mage as the only tools required:

```bash
cd applications/agent-architecture
mage run
```

To validate and run one agent directly from its YAML profile:

```bash
cd agent-core
mage build      # compiles cmd/ binaries into bin/
export AGENT_CATALOG_ROOT=../applications/catalog
bin/agent --profile "$AGENT_CATALOG_ROOT/agents/executor/profile.yaml" --validate-config
bin/agent --profile "$AGENT_CATALOG_ROOT/agents/executor/profile.yaml" --core-root .
```

`--validate-config` reads the profile, machine, and tool definitions, then exits without serving — the same boot smoke the audit gates run over every shipped profile. Swap `executor` for any profile under [`applications/catalog/agents/`](applications/catalog/agents/).

## Build

This repository uses [Mage](https://magefile.org/) for builds. From the repo root:

```bash
mage            # run default target in each sub-module
mage build      # build artifacts in each sub-module
mage audit      # run the release analysis gate in each sub-module
mage test       # run tests for applicable sub-modules
mage stats      # combined LOC and per-agent stats (states, transitions, tools, YAML) as JSON
mage clean      # remove generated artifacts in each sub-module
mage tag        # create the canonical repository release tag
```

Each sub-module also has its own mage targets. Run `mage -l` inside any directory with a `magefiles/` folder to list available targets.

`mage test` rebuilds every tracked shipped UI from a clean lockfile install. It
audits the full build dependency graph and the production-only graph separately;
either scope fails the release gate at any known high or critical vulnerability.

### Persistent integration observability

The persistent OTLP ingress is the canonical collector agent run as a host
process: it receives both trace and metric exports on one gRPC listener and
retains them in its spool, so no docker-compose stack or Prometheus backend is
involved and kind stays the only Docker consumer. Run
`mage observability:up|status|down|reset` from `applications/chatbot-mesh`,
which owns the ingress; its ports and lifecycle are documented in the
[chatbot-mesh README](applications/chatbot-mesh/README.md).

Root releases require every release gate to exit successfully before tagging:
`mage audit`, `mage lint`, `mage test`, `agent-core` and
`applications/catalog` `mage integration:all`, catalog `mage conformance` using
repository discovery, and application-owned gates from each application root.
A documented skip reported by a gate is accepted only when that gate exits
successfully. A failed gate cannot be waived; fix the failure and run the gates
again before creating a tag.
The agent-core integration suite is limited to runtime service boundaries:
embedded monitor wiring, Ollama REST and metrics, and Dolt persistence.
Application workflows such as planner-executor-critic run from
`applications/coding-agent`.

`mage tag` requires a clean `main` worktree, records the exact HEAD commit, runs
all gates above itself, and verifies HEAD is unchanged before creating the tag.
The repository audit is the exclusive first gate. After it passes, a
resource-aware scheduler makes every other lane eligible: CPU-only root,
catalog, and agent-core work shares one CPU slot; application integrations share
three Docker slots; and Chatbot Mesh and agent-core share one host-Ollama slot.
Chatbot Mesh has launch priority for that host-Ollama slot, allowing all three
application lanes plus one CPU-heavy gate to overlap without unbounded host
contention. Gates in the same lane remain serial (including catalog integration
before conformance). On failure, the scheduler starts no new gates, lets every
in-flight child finish its own cleanup, and reports the failed gate with the
earliest canonical gate order.
It also acquires a Git-private repository lock before checking or running any
gate, so a second invocation fails with the active process metadata instead of
competing for test, model, Docker, and kind resources. The lock is removed on a
normal return; after a force-killed process, remove a stale lock only after
confirming no `mage tag` process remains.
Revision selection queries the configured remote before choosing N, so a
checkout missing fetched tags still picks the next available revision. It
creates the single repository tag `v0.YYYYMMDD.N`. Module-scoped tags
(`agent-core/v0.*`, `applications/catalog/v0.*`, `agent-profiles/v0.*`, and the
per-application tags) stopped at GH-1373; the existing ones remain immutable.

### agent-core

```bash
cd agent-core
mage build    # compile cmd/ binaries into bin/
mage lint     # run golangci-lint
mage stats    # LOC and YAML breakdowns (JSON)
```

### design-patterns

```bash
cd design-patterns
mage figures  # render PlantUML diagrams to PNG
mage pdf      # compile IEEE two-column PDF
mage clean    # remove generated artifacts
```

### applications/chatbot-mesh

```bash
cd applications/chatbot-mesh
mage audit                  # validate the application's spec corpus
mage observability:up       # start the persistent collector ingress its gates need
mage helm:package           # build the installable chart
mage integration:helmSmoke  # prove the packaged mesh on kind
```

The application is copyable with two documented platform dependencies:
agent-core at runtime and the canonical catalog corpus-ingest block at build and
local-integration time. Set `AGENT_CATALOG_ROOT` when the catalog is not in the
monorepo checkout. Its Helm chart is under
[`applications/chatbot-mesh/helm/`](applications/chatbot-mesh/helm/) and its own docs
live under [`applications/chatbot-mesh/docs/`](applications/chatbot-mesh/docs/).

### applications/coding-agent

```bash
cd applications/coding-agent
mage audit                  # validate docs, closure, boot, and test evidence
mage package                # assemble canonical application profile closures
mage image:build            # build the profile-free coding runtime
mage helm:package           # build the installable chart
mage integration:helmSmoke  # prove planner → executor → critic on kind
```

Canonical entry points are
[`agents/application.yaml`](applications/coding-agent/agents/application.yaml),
[`Dockerfile`](applications/coding-agent/Dockerfile), and
[`helm/`](applications/coding-agent/helm/); architecture and operations live under
[`docs/`](applications/coding-agent/docs/).

### applications/agent-architecture

```bash
cd applications/agent-architecture
mage run      # start the canonical catalog documentation-curator
mage present  # serve agent-architecture.slide with the pinned Go present tool
```

The application is a composition-only consumer of
[`applications/catalog/`](applications/catalog/): it owns the presentation and
lifecycle-exit flow but does not copy or recount the documentation-curator.
Setup, ports, and the declarative exit command are documented in the
[application README](applications/agent-architecture/README.md).
